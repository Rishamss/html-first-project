    <p<blockquote style="font-size: 20px;"> Made his Test debut on <i>6 September 2001</i> against Sri Lanka. He scored highest in each inning, and although Bangladesh slumped to an innings defeat, Ashraful scored 114, becoming the youngest player to score a Test century, breaking Mushtaq Mohammad's record.<br>
       As a result, he was named man of the match. He was the second Bangladesh player to score a Test century on debut after <i>Aminul Islam Bulbul </i>in 2000 during Bangladesh's first Test.<br><hr>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;"> <strong><abbr title="Coach">Trevor Chappell</abbr> </strong> , a former coach of Bangladesh's national side, commented that: <i style="font-size: 20px; background-color: rgb(201, 201, 253) ;">"his determination, commitment and attention to detail would put a mature and an established person to shame. The manner he concentrates on his batting made me believe that the lad is destined to have a long cricketing journey. Following Ashraful's debut century, however, a prolonged string of poor performances resulted in him being dropped from the national team".</mark></i></p></p>
